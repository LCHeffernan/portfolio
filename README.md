# Portfolio.

## Description.
This is the first version of my portfolio page, which I created when I first started learning HTML and CSS with the Manchester Code course. I hope to create another version of my portfolio using all the skills I have learnt on the Manchester codes course once the course has finished. I would like to write it using React and SASS.
