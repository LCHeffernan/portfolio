# Portfolio.

## Description.
This is the first version of my portfolio page, which I created when I first started learning HTML and CSS with the Manchester Code course. I haven't yet learnt how to make the submit button fully functional. This is something I hope to accomplish when I create another version of my portfolio using React.
